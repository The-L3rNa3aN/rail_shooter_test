This is a page where I will be publishing development builds of an unnamed rail shooter idea I came up with.
Everything in this page including this "README" will of course, be subject to change. My other intention
was to exhibit the project's history of development. How it started and how it evolved with each
development build. I cannot guarantee steady progress with this game project. At least there is progress,
but it's gonna be pretty slow.

The project's source code will not be made publicly available for obvious reasons but you can always try
implementing it based on how you interpret my explanations in the devlogs. I don't know how to handle
feedback but I guess you could raise it in the "Issues" tab or perhaps email me about it. It goes without
saying, but I will not address spam or unintelligible email that is not relevant to any of this.
